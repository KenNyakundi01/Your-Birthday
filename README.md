Birthweek

It is a web application that calculates the day of the week they were born.
And according to the day it assigns you an Akan name.
It is derived from a Ghanean culture where the baby is given a specific name depending on the day he/she is born.
It works when you enter your gender, date of bith and year of birth and click the calculate button.
